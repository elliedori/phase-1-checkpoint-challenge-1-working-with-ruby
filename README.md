#Checkpoint Challenge #1: Working with Ruby

Below you will find the first of four checkpoint challenges for Phase 1

Checkpoint challenges...
* familiarize you with the way phase assessments are taken at DBC
* give you a better understanding on how well you're learning the new material
* give you some solo code for your advisor to code review

You have 45 minutes to complete the work below.
* The core releases are "must have"; the stretch release is only "nice to have"
* You may use Google, your notes and your old code.
* You may NOT use your cohort-mates or look at their code.
* You may ask teachers and mentors clarifying questions (e.g. if you are having trouble understanding what is being asked)
* Remember to commit at least once per release and push at the designated time - not when you are done.

Afterwards...
* You will talk through the problem with your cohort-mates
* You will evaluate your own work using [this rubric](./rubric.md)
* You will get either a GitHub or in-person code review with your advisor (tag them in the pull request)

#Release 0: TDD

The first part of this challenge is an example of test-driven development.  In this case, someone
else has written the tests for you.  Do not change the tests, but do take a look
at them to get familiar with this problem.  Remember that the goal is to
implement the desired functionality, not *just* getting the given tests to pass.

Find the specs in ```./spec/data_structures_spec.rb```

When you have a good grasp on what the tests are looking for go to ```./data_structures.rb``` and implement the methods ```#search_in_array``` and ```#numbers_in_hash```

Note: Some tests are pending. This is denoted by the x in front of the it statement. These tests are for a future release. So don't worry about them just yet.

#Release 1: Hello Siri

Open ```hello_siri.rb``` Have a look over the method here and determine what functionality the author is trying to achieve.

Open ```./spec/hello_siri_spec.rb``` Write at least five (5) passing specs to properly test the ```hello_siri``` function.

Feel free to use the previously provided specs as a guide if you are unsure how to proceed.

#Stretch Release: #Non-Repeating-Chars

Remove the x from the xit specs inside the '#non_repeating_chars' describe block.  Get them to pass.
