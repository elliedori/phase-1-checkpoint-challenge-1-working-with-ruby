# Weak Attempt

* few or no tests are passing for release 0
* few or no tests written for release 1
* some pseudo-code or comments indicate where you got stuck and why

# Some Success

* some tests are passing for release 0
* at least one new test written for release 1
* indentation limits readability
* naming of variables and methods prevents clear understanding of code

# Meets Expectations

* all tests are passing for release 0
* at least 5 tests written for release 1
* indentation is mostly structured to lend for reading code fluidly
* variable and method naming is mostly human-readable and follows most Ruby naming conventions
* code is mostly easy to understand

# Exceeds Expectations

* code is DRY
* all tests are passing for release 0
* at least 5 tests written for release 1
* methods have a single responsibility
* indentation is flawless
* variable and method naming is human-readable and follows Ruby convention
* your Ruby is idiomatic, e.g. Enumerable#map/select instead of always iterating
* you have made some progress in the Stretch Release (ideally you designed your code to work with the stretch release from the start)
